# skrub teaching materials

This repository contains slides and other material that I made to present skrub in various venues.

I'm separating this repo from the [skrub materials](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub-materials) repo to make it easier to manage single slide decks, and avoid having to deal with the website.

Once the slides are ready, they are added to the skrub-materials repo.
