## DataOps, Plans, `learner`s: oh my!  
- A `DataOp` (singular) wraps a single operation, and can be combined and concatenated with other `DataOps`. 

- The **Data Ops** Plan is a collective name for the directed computational graph
that tracks a sequence and combination of `DataOps`. 

- The plan can be exported as a standalone object called `learner`. The `learner` 
works like a scikit-learn estimator that takes a dictionary of values rather 
than just `X` and `y`.
